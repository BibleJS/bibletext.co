A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project xup on GitHub and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.
I also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,
without being too specific. In the worst case you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,
if for example you are only interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.

Chances are you do not need all authentication methods or API examples. As of **Hackathon Starter 2.1**
it is possible to selectively check which authentication methods you need by running `node setup.js`.

:exclamation: **Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

:exclamation: **Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

Generator
---------

Hackathon Starter Generator is currently in the experimental stage. It is tighly
tied to the project code. As soon as you start changing and moving things around,
it will probably no longer work as expected. That is why it's best to use when
you first download the project.

Currently it supports removing authentication providers, switching
between SendGrid, Mailgun and Mandrill email services and adding a Node.js
cluster support.

To get started, run: `node setup.js`.

:exclamation: **Note:** Generator has a "destructive" behavior, it will physically
modify your code. *There is no undo action.* To be on a safe side, always commit
your code to Git, so you could go back and revert the changes.

Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

**Hackathon Starter 2.0 Update:** I have included dummy keys and passwords for
all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with *your credentials* when you are ready to deploy an app.

 - **Authorized Javascript origins**: http://localhost:3000
 - **Authorized redirect URI**: http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
- Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* keys into `config/secrets.js`

:exclamation: **Note:** When you ready to deploy to production don't forget to
add your new url to *Authorized Javascript origins* and *Authorized redirect URI*,
e.g. `http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com` and
`http://my-awesome-app.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback` respectively.
The same goes for other providers.

:exclamation: **Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

Pro Tips
--------

- When installing an NPM package, add a *--save* flag, and it will be automatially
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template
after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)
as part of the CSRF protection.

```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)
```

**Note:** It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can
specify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.

**Note 2:** To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the
CSRF middleware to see if `req.originalUrl` matches your desired pattern.

### What is cluster_app.js?

**Note**: It is now part of the generator as of **v2.1**.

From the [Node.js Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html#cluster_how_it_works):
> A single instance of Node runs in a single thread. To take advantage of multi-core systems
> the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of Node processes to handle the load.
> The cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that all share server ports.

Running `cluster_app.js` allows you to take advantage of this feature by forking
a process of `app.js` for each detected CPU. For the majority of applications
serving HTTP requests, this is a nice benefit. However, the cluster module is
still in experimental stage, therefore it should only be used after understanding
its purpose and behavior. To use it, simply run `node cluster_app.js`.
**Its use is entirely optional and `app.js` is not tied in any way to it**.
As a reminder, if you plan to use `cluster_app.js` instead of `app.js`,
be sure to indicate that in `package.json` when you are ready to deploy your app.

### What is this Rails 3.1-style asset pipeline that you mentioned under Features?
This is how you typically define static files inside HTML, Jade or any template
for that matter:

```jade
link(href='/css/styles.css', rel='stylesheet')
script(src='/js/lib/jquery-2.1.0.min.js')
script(src='/js/lib/bootstrap.min.js')
script(src='/js/main.js')
```

Simple enough right? But wouldn't it be nice to have it just like that in
development mode, but when you deploy your app to production, have it minified
and concatenated into a single file automatically without any extra effort on
your part?

```jade
link(href='/css/styles.css', rel='stylesheet')
script(src='/js/application.js')
```

As soon as you start bringing in more JavaScript libraries, the benefits of
concatenating and minifying JavaScript files will be even greater. Using
**connect-assets** library, it is  as as simple as declaring these two lines:

```
!= css('styles')      // expects public/css/styles.less
!= js('application')  // expects public/js/application.js
```

:bulb: **Tip:** We can use `css` and `js` functions in Jade templates because in
**connect-assets** middleware options we have added this line: `helperContext: app.locals`.

The only thing you need to remember is to define your JavaScript files inside
`public/js/application.js` using this strange syntax notation (Sprockets-style)
borrowed from Rails. I know it's an extra thing to learn for someone who has
never seen Rails asset pipeline before, but in this case, I think benefits
outweigh the cost.

```js
//= require lib/jquery-2.1.0.min
//= require lib/bootstrap.min
//= require main
```

Using this approach, when working in development mode, **connect-assets** will
load each file individually, without minifying or concatenating anything.
When you deploy your app, it will run in production mode, and so **connect-assets**
will automatically serve a single concatenated & minified `application.js`.
For more information see [Sprockets-style concatenation](https://github.com/adunkman/connect-assets/#sprockets-style-concatenation)
section.

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:

```js
mongoose.connection.on('error', function() {
  console.error('✗ MongoDB Connection Error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.');
});
```
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can
download MongoDB [here](mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.
<img src="http://dc942d419843af05523b-ff74ae13537a01be6cfec5927837dcfe.r14.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-8-50x50.jpg" height="17">
Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

:bulb: **Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
[MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/) or [MongoHQ](https://www.mongohq.com/) instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update the
`db` property in `config/secrets.js`.

### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?
Chances are you haven't changed the *Dabatase URI* in `secrets.js`. If `db` is
set to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is
running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB
running on `localhost`. You need to create an account with [MongoLab](http://mongolab.com)
or [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com), then create a free tier database.
See [Deployment](#deployment) for more information on how to setup an account
and a new database step-by-step with MongoLab.

### Why Jade instead of Handlebars?
When I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.

### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?
For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,
such as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this
[blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/),
I find such style to be confusing for beginners.
It took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`,
let alone having a global `app` reference in other files.
That to me is a backward thinking.
The `app.js` is the "heart of the app", it should be the one referencing
models, routes, controllers, etc.
When working solo on small projects I actually prefer to have everything inside `app.js` as is the case with [this]((https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js))
REST API server.

### I don't need a sticky footer, can I delete it?
Absolutely. But unlike a regular footer there is a bit more work involved.
First, delete `#wrap` and `#footer` ID selectors and `html, body { height: 100%; }`
from **styles.less**. Next, delete `#wrap` and `#footer` lines from **layout.jade**
(By the way, if no element is specified before class or id, Jade assumes it is
a `div` element). Don't forget to indent everything under `#wrap` to the left
once, since this project uses two spaces per block indentation.

### Why is there no Mozilla Persona as a sign-in option?
If you would like to use **Persona** authentication strategy, use the
[pull request #64](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/64) as a
reference guide. I have explained my reasons why it could not be merged in
[issue #63](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/issues/63#issuecomment-34898290).

### How do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service?
Run `node setup.js` bundled with Hackathon Starter, then select
**Email Service** option. It will automatically replace appropriate strings in
your code. Currently there are three options: SendGrid, Mandrill, and Mailgun.

### Can I use Sass instead of LESS stylesheets?
Yes you can! Although you will have to manually convert all existing stylesheets
to Sass, which shouldn't be too hard considering how similar Sass and LESS are.
Simply rename `styles.less` to `styles.scss` and **connect-assets** will
automatically use Sass preprocessor.

Your are not limited to just Sass *or* LESS, you could use both if you want to.
In **layout.jade** simply specify LESS and Sass stylesheets separately:
```jade
!= css('styles') # public/css/styles.less
!= css('my_sass_styles') # public/css/my_sass_styles.scss
```

And as I already mentioned you do not need to specify the file extension,
**connect-assets** will automatically figure out which CSS preprocessor to use
based on the filetype.

**Note:** I did not include `node-sass` module in *package.json*, so you will
have to install it yourself by running `npm install --save node-sass`.


How It Works (mini guides)
--------------------------

This section is intended for giving you a detailed explanation about
how a particular functionality works. Maybe you are just curious about
how it works, or maybe you are lost and confused while reading the code,
I hope it provides some guidance to you.

###:rose: Custom HTML and CSS Design 101
[HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) has many beautiful templates that you can download for free.

When you download the ZIP file, it will come with *index.html*, *images*, *css* and *js* folders. So, how do you
integrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not.
Trying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects.

:exclamation: **Note:** Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, home page, api browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. **Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page.**

Let's start from the beginning. For this example I will use [Escape Velocity](http://html5up.net/escape-velocity/) template:
![Alt](http://html5up.net/uploads/images/escape-velocity.jpg)

**Note:** For the sake of simplicity I will only consider `index.html`, and skip `left-sidebar.html`,
`no-sidebar.html`, `right-sidebar.html`.

Move all javascript files from `html5up-escape-velocity/js` to `public/js`. Then move all css files from `html5up-escape-velocity/css` to `public/css`. And finally, move all images from `html5up-escape-velocity/images` to `public/images` (You could move it to the existing **img** folder, but then you would have to manually change every `img` reference). Grab the contents of `index.html` and paste it into [HTML To Jade](http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/).

Create a new file `escape-velocity.jade` and paste the Jade markup there. Change `!!! 5` to `doctype html`. It's a fairly recent
change in **Jade** language, but [HTML To Jade](http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/) hasn't caught up to this change yet.

Let's see how it looks. Create a new controller **escapeVelocity** inside `controllers/home.js`:

```js
exports.escapeVelocity = function(req, res) {
  res.render('escape-velocity', {
    title: 'Landing Page'
  });
};
```

And then create a route in `app.js`. I placed it right after the index controller:
```js
app.get('/escape-velocity', homeController.escapeVelocity);
```

Restart the server (if you are not using **nodemon**), then you should see the new template at [http://localhost:3000/escape-velocity](http://localhost:3000/escape-velocity).

I will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Jade templates work: `layout.jade` - base template, `index.jade` - home page, `partials/navigation.jade` - Bootstrap navbar, `partials/footer.jade` - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that's your new `layout.jade`.
Then, each page that changes, be it `index.jade`, `about.jade`, `contact.jade`
will be embedded in your new `layout.jade` via `block content`. Use existing templates as a reference.

This is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere,
might have yet another grid system. That's why I chose *Bootstrap* for the Hackathon Starter.
 Many people are already familiar with *Bootstrap*, plus it's easy to get started with it if you have never used *Bootstrap*.
 You can also buy many beautifully designed *Bootstrap* themes at [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/), and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML/CSS design, this should help you to get started!

###:bulb: How do flash messages work in this project?
Flash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access
it on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would
display an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different
page and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.
This project uses *express-flash* module for flash messages. And that
module is built on top of *connect-flash*, which is what I used in
this project initially. With *express-flash* you don't have to
explicity send a flash message to every view inside `res.render()`.
All flash messages are available in your views via `messages` object by default,
thanks to *express-flash*.

Flash messages have a two-step process. You use `req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }`
to create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:
```jade
if messages.errors
  .alert.alert-danger.fade.in
    for error in messages.errors
      div= error.msg
```
In the first step, `'errors'` is the name of a flash message, which should match the
name of the property on `messages` object in your views. You place alert messages
inside `if message.errors` because you don't want to show them flash messages are actually present.
The reason why you pass an error like `{ msg: 'Error messages goes here' }` instead
of just a string - `'Error messages goes here'`, is for the sake of consistency.
To clarify that, *express-validator* module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input,
returns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a `msg` property with a message
why an error has occured. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:

```js
[
  { param: "name", msg: "Name is required", value: "<received input>" },
  { param: "email", msg: "A valid email is required", value: "<received input>" }
]
```

To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages
as `{ msg: 'My flash message' }` instead of a string. Otherwise you will just see an alert box
without an error message. That is because, in **partials/flash.jade** template it will try to output
`error.msg` (i.e. `"My flash message".msg`), in other words it will try to call a `msg` method on a *String* object,
which will return *undefined*. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies
to "info" and "success" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:

**Data Usage Controller (Example)**
```
req.flash('warning', { msg: 'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage' });
```

**User Account Page (Example)**
```jade
if messages.warning
  .alert.alert-warning.fade.in
    for warning in messages.warning
      div= warning.msg
```

`partials/flash.jade` is a partial template that contains how flash messages
are formatted. Previously, flash
messages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages
(contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it is uses a *DRY* approach.

The flash messages partial template is *included* in the `layout.jade`, along with footer and navigation.
```jade
body
  #wrap
    include partials/navigation
    .container
      include partials/flash
      block content
  include partials/footer
```

If you have any further questions about flash messages,
please feel free to open an issue and I will update this mini-guide accordingly,
or send a pull request if you  would like to include something that I missed.

###:snowman: How do I create a new page?
A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a new route". The main file `app.js` contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.

```js
app.get('/account', passportConf.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware
checks if you are authenticated:

```js
exports.isAuthenticated = function(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to *Account Management* page, otherwise you will be redirected to *Login* page.

```js
exports.getAccount = function(req, res) {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```

Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building
a page that lists all books from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.0 you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
```

And here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:

```js
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConf.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConf.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter);
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
```

Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I really think that chaining HTTP verbs on
`app.route` is very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand I can no longer see all my routes at a glance
when you have one route per line.

---

**Step 2.** Create a new controller file called `book.js`.
```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */

exports.getBooks = function(req, res) {
  Book.find(function(err, docs) {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 3.** Import that controller in `app.js`.
```js
var bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 4.** Create `books.jade` template.
```jade
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books', function(req, res) {
  Book.find(function(err, docs) {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes
difficult to maintain everything in a single file.

That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,
sending emails via [Nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,
parsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio), and etc.

###:dizzy: How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?
[Dan Stroot](https://github.com/dstroot) submitted an excellent [pull request](https://github.com/dstroot/hackathon-starter/commit/0a632def1ce8da446709d92812423d337c977d75) that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io.
And as  much as I'd like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main
principles of the Hackathon Starter:
> When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.
> I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of
> hackathon web apps, **without being too specific**.

When I need to use socket.io, I **really** need it, but most of the time - I don't. But more
importantly, websockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. As of October 2013,
Heroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:

```js
heroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp
```

And what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a
preview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:

```js
var socket = io.connect('http://yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000');
```

Wait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn't run across this [blog post](http://velin-georgiev-blog.appspot.com/blog/set-up-nodejs-express-socketio-application-using-websockets-on-openshift-by-red-hat/)
I wouldn't even know I had to use port 8000.

I am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least
have a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.
Due to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. *For now...*
If you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.

First you need to install socket.io:
```js
npm install socket.io --save
```

Replace `var app = express();` with the following code:

```js
var app = express();
var server = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(server);
```

I like to have the following code organization in `app.js` (from top to bottom): module dependencies,
import controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,
start the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.

Add the following code at the end of `app.js`:

```js
io.on('connection', function(socket) {
  socket.emit('greet', { hello: 'Hey there browser!' });
  socket.on('respond', function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', function() {
    console.log('Socket disconnected');
  });
});
```

One last thing left to change:
```js
app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
```
to
```js
server.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
```

At this point we are done with the back-end.

You now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Jade templates or have all your client-side
JavaScript in a separate file - in `main.js`. I will admit, when I first started out with Node.js and JavaScript in general,
I placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express
right then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I
almost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.

But it's also understandable if you want take the easier road.
Most of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just
want to [*"get shit done"*](http://www.startupvitamins.com/media/products/13/aaron_levie_poster_black.jpg) before the time runs out.
Well, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,
it's **what** you build that matters, not **how** you build it.

If you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in `layout.jade` -
your main template file, add this to `head` block.

```jade
script(src='/socket.io/socket.io.js')
script.
    var socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
    socket.on('greet', function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hey there, server!' });
    });
```

**Note:** Notice the path of the `socket.io.js`, you don't actually
have to have `socket.io.js` file anywhere in your project; it will be generated
automatically at runtime.

If you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline
script code into `main.js`, inside the `$(document).ready()` function:

```js
$(document).ready(function() {

  // Place JavaScript code here...
  var socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
  socket.on('greet', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hello to you too, Mr.Server!' });
  });

});
```

And that's it, we are done!

[live example](http://hackathonstarter.herokuapp.com/dashboard). Refer to the
[pull request #23](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/23/files) to
see how it is implemented.

Mongoose Cheatsheet
-------------------

#### Find all users:
```js
User.find(function(err, users) {
  console.log(users);
});
```

#### Find a user by email:
```js
var userEmail = 'example@gmail.com';
User.findOne({ email: userEmail }, function(err, user) {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Find 5 most recent user accounts:
```js
User
  .find()
  .sort({ _id: -1 })
  .limit(5)
  .exec(function(err, users) {
    console.log(users);
  });
```

#### Get total count of a field from all documents:
Let's suppose that each user has a `votes` field and you would like to count
the total number of votes in your database accross all users. One very
inefficient way would be to loop through each document and manually accumulate
the count. Or you could use [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) instead:

```js
User.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: '$votes' } } }, function(err, votesCount) {
  console.log(votesCount.total);
});
```

Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **MongoLab** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:add mongolab` to set up Mongo and configure your environment variables
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**:exclamation:Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

---

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7KnCa5a.png" width="200">
- Open [mongolab.com](https://mongolab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `secrets.js` instead of `db: 'localhost'`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**:exclamation:Note:** As an alternative to MongoLab, there is also [MongoHQ](http://www.mongohq.com/home).


<img src="http://www.opencloudconf.com/images/openshift_logo.png" width="200">
- First, install this Ruby gem: `sudo gem install rhc` :gem:
- Run `rhc login` and enter your OpenShift credentials
- From *your app* directory run `rhc app create MyApp nodejs-0.10`
 - **Note:** *MyApp* is what you want to name your app (no spaces)
- Once that is done, you will be provided with **URL**, **SSH** and **Git Remote** links
- Visit that **URL** and you should see *Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift* page
- Copy **Git Remote** and paste it into `git remote add openshift your_git_remote`
- Before you push your app, you need to do a few modifications to your code

Add these two lines to `app.js`, just place them anywhere before `app.listen()`:
```js
var IP_ADDRESS = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || '127.0.0.1';
var PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;
```

Then change `app.listen()` to:
```js
app.listen(PORT, IP_ADDRESS, function() {
  console.log("✔ Express server listening on port %d in %s mode", PORT, app.settings.env);
});
```
Add this to `package.json`, after *name* and *version*. This is necessary because, by default, OpenShift looks for `server.js` file. And by specifying `supervisor app.js` it will automatically restart the server when node.js process crashes.

```js
"main": "app.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "supervisor app.js"
},
```

- Finally, now you can push your code to OpenShift by running `git push -f openshift master`
 - **Note:** The first time you run this command, you have to pass `-f` (force) flag because OpenShift creates a dummy server with the welcome page when you create a new Node.js app. Passing `-f` flag will override everything with your *Hackathon Starter* project repository. Please **do not** do `git pull` as it will create unnecessary merge conflicts.
- And you are done! (Not quite as simple as Heroku, huh?)

<img src="http://www.joyent.com/content/08-company/05-customers/13-nodejitsu/header.png" width="200">
- To install **jitsu**, open a terminal and type: `sudo npm install -g jitsu`
- Run `jitsu login` and enter your login credentials
- From your app directory, run `jitsu deploy`
 - This will create a new application snapshot, generate and/or update project metadata
- Done!

<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Windows_Azure_logo.png" width="200">

- Login to [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/)
- Click the **+ NEW** button on the bottom left of the portal
- Click **WEB SITE**, then **QUICK CREATE**
- Enter a name for **URL** and select the datacenter **REGION** for your web site
- Click on **CREATE WEB SITE** button
- Once the web site status changes to *Running*, click on the name of the web site to access the Dashboard
- At the bottom right of the Quickstart page, select **Set up a deployment from source control**
- Select **Local Git repository** from the list, and then click the arrow
- To enable Git publishing, Azure will ask you to create a user name and password
- Once the Git repository is ready, you will be presented with a **GIT URL**
- Inside your *Hackathon Starter* directory, run `git remote add azure [Azure Git URL]`
- To push your changes simply run `git push azure master`
 - **Note:** *You will be prompted for the password you created earlier*
- On **Deployments** tab of your Windows Azure Web Site, you will see the deployment history

<img src="http://www.comparethecloud.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ibm-bluemix_pr-030514.jpg" width="200">

- Go to [Codename: Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) to signup for the free trial, or login with your *IBM id*
- Install [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
- Navigate to your **hackathon-starter** directory and then run `cf push [your-app-name] -m 512m` command to deploy the application
 - **Note:** You must specify a unique application name in place of `[your-app-name]`
- Run `cf create-service mongodb 100 [your-service-name]` to create a [MongoDB service](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/MongoDB/index.html#MongoDB)
- Run `cf bind-service [your-app-name] [your-service-name]` to associate your application with a service created above
- Run `cf files [your-app-name] logs/env.log` to see the *environment variables created for MongoDB.
- Copy the **MongoDB URI** that should look something like the following: `mongodb://68638358-a3c6-42a1-bae9-645b607d55e8:46fb97e6-5ce7-4146-9a5d-d623c64ff1fe@192.155.243.23:10123/db`
- Then set it as an environment variable for your application by running `cf set-env [your-app-name] MONGODB [your-mongodb-uri]`
- Run `cf restart [your-app-name]` for the changes to take effect.
- Visit your starter app at **http://[your-app-name].ng.bluemix.net**
- Done!
